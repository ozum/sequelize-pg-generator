# DEPRECIATION NOTICE: Use [pg-generator](http://www.pg-generator.com)

Project is renamed as [pg-generator](http://www.pg-generator.com) which

* is flexible and easier to customize, (uses nunjucks templates)
* generates more than sequelize, (provides example templates for sequelize, objection, schwifty etc.)

Türkçe: [Turkish Documentation is here](https://github.com/ozum/sequelize-pg-generator/blob/master/README-TR.md)

Old module and its documentation is preserved here for reference purposes.

Description
-----------
This module is for auto generating Sequelize model from PostgreSQL databases. It reverse engineers your database and generates separate model files for each table. Default configuration parameters are carefully selected and they are sane to use. However it is possible to change most of the behaviours via configuration. This document is based on default configuration. Configuration parameters and default values are written as (Config parameter:value) where appropriate.

Usage
-----

### Step 1: Install globally via npm -g

This will install module and CLI command

    $ npm install -g sequelize-pg-generator

### Step 2: Generate model files

Open terminal, go to your app.js root and create your models automatically into 'model' directory.

    $ cd path/to/my/node-app.js
    $ spgen -d my_database -u my_user -p my_password

### Step 3: Use it in your node.js app

Use Sequelize models provided by auto generated files in your application. See examples below.

    var orm = require('./model');
    orm.setup('my_database', 'my_user', 'my_password', {
        host: '127.0.0.1',
        logging: false,
        native: false
    });
    var sequelize = orm.sequelize;
    var contact = orm.model('public.contact'); // Can be configured without schema.

Windows Users
-------------
Some tips to install on windows. This module uses pg. If you like to use pg-native, below are some tips for windows users for a successful install:

* Python 2 should be installed. As of this writing it is not compatible with Python 3.
* You should add Python to the path and set PYTHONPATH via environment variables.
* PostgreSQL pg_config and libpq.dll must be on path. Usually adding bin and lib folders is ok. (For eaxmple: C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\9.3\bin C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\9.3\lib)
* Visual Studio Build Tools (C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild) should be installed. Installed automatically after VS 2012. If during install npm asks for different version of Visual Studio you can set it from command line during installation:
    > npm install -g sequelize-pg-generator --msvs_version=2013

CLI Options
-----------
    spgen [options]
    -h, --host [host]           IP address or host name of the database server
        --port [port]           Port of database server to connect
    -d, --database [database]   Database name
    -u, --user [user]           Username to connect to database

    -t, --templateName          Use builtin template folder with given name
        --nolog                 No log output
        --resetConfig           Reset configuration. (Side-step. Not for production.)
        --throwError            Instead of logging errors to console, throws error.

WARNING: belongsToMany
----------------------
For many to many relations Sequelize version 2.0 RC3 and older does not support belongsToMany relation. After this version hasMany through relations are deprecated. Behaviour on this subject can be adjusted via configuration. (Config: generate.hasManyThrough:false and generate.belongsToMany:true)

Features
--------

### No Dependencies On Generated Files
Generated files have no dependencies besides core modules and Sequelize.

### Multi Schema Support
Supports multi PostgreSQL schemas. It is possible to have other schemas than public. User can select which schemas to reverse engineer via CLI or config. If more than one schema is included, models may be prefixed with schema names (Config: generate.useSchemaName: true, database.schema: ["public"]) to prevent tables with same name in different schemas try to have same model name.

    contact = orm.model('public.contact'); // Returns sequelize model for contact table.
    
### No Schema Prefix
User can configure not to prefix model names with schema
    
    // In config
    {...
        generate{
            useSchemaName: false
        }
    }
    
    contact = orm.model('contact'); // Returns sequelize model for contact table.
    
### One To Many Relation Support
This module automatically detects one to many relations and generates model.hasMany and model.belongsTo sequelize relations.

### Many To Many Relation Support
If two tables are joined via a join table this module detects it automatically and generates many to many sequelize relations. If a table has more than one foreign key, then it is considered many to many relation join table.

                      hasMany              hasMany
    TABLE:   product --------< line_item >--------- cart
    COLUMNS: id                cart_id (FK)         id
             name              product_id (FK)      customer_id (FK)
             color             quantity

This module generates belongsToMany relation and hasMany relation with through option. As of this writing master branch of Sequelize deprecated hasMany through relations. According to version of Sequelize you use, it should be adjusted via config of this module.

### Inter-Schema Relation Support
Detects relations between tables in different schemas. For example relations between public.account table and other_schema.customer table.

### Highly configurable
This module uses [config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/config) module. It is also possible to point a custom configuration file via CLI. See configuration parameters below in this document.

### Fully Customizable
This module uses [consolidate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/consolidate) compatible templates to generate model files. It uses [Swig](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swig) by default. User can use his/her custom templates without altering original one by pointing (Config: template.folder and template.engine:'swig') config values. Looking default templates in template folder of this module is highly recommended.

There should at least be three files in custom template folder:
    index.ext  Default template file. ext is whatever extension is used for your template engine.
    index.js   This file is copied with generated files. It's purpose is use generated files
    utils.js   This file is copied with generated files. Contains helper functions.

### CLI Support
If this module is installed as suggested globally with npm -g then spgen command would be available system wide to generate model files.

### Easily Override Relationship Aliases and Smart Names
If auto generated relationship names and aliases are not so smart for you, it is very easy to override aliases. After first use, a file called `alias.json` is generated in output folder. Every alias name generated is listed in this file. You can override any names/aliases. Future generated files will use overridden names from this file. If you are OK with some names, leave it as null. 

### Smart Naming of Models and Relations
sequelize-pg-generator uses table names or schema.table names for model naming. For relations it uses foreign key names and relation names from your database. (You are naming your relations in database meaningfully right?) Both camel case (tableName) or untouched names (table_name) methods can be used via configuration. Naming conventions are based on Sequelize module suggestions and generated explicitly with 'as' parameter.

                      product_cart_line_items              cart_cart_line_items
    TABLE:   product -------------------------< line_item >--------------------- cart
    COLUMNS: id                                 cart_id (FK)                     id
             name                               product (FK)                     customer_id (FK)
             color                              quantity

    NOTE: Beware line_item.cart_id has id suffix but line_item.product hasn't. This inconsistency is made purposefully for the sake of this example.

    Type of object          Naming Rule
    --------------          -----------
    Model                   tableName or schema.tableName
    hasMany                 Plural of the relation name in database. Table name from beginning can be stripped.
                            (Config: generate.stripFirstTableFromHasMany:true)
    belongsTo               Singular of foreign key. If key name ends with _id it will be stripped. Otherwise
                            'related' is added at the beginning to prevent it gets clash with column name.
                            (Config: generate.prefixForBelongsTo:'related')
    belongsToMany           Plural of the join table name + foreign key which refers other table in join table.
    hasMany({through:..})   Plural of the join table name + foreign key which refers other table in join table. (DEPRECATED in Sequelize)

    For the example structure:

    Relation                as                                  Details
    --------                --                                  -------
    product.hasMany         as:'cartLineItems'                  (Plural) Table name 'product' is stripped from the beginning
                                                                of relation name 'product_cart_line_items'
    product.belongsToMany   as:'cartLineItemCarts'              (Plural) _id suffix is stripped from, relation name (table name striiped)
                                                                added to foreign key name 'cart_id'
    product.hasMany Through as:'cartLineItemCarts'              (Plural) _id suffix is stripped from, relation name (table name striiped)
                                                                added to foreign key name 'cart_id'
    cart.hasMany            as:'cartLineItems'                  (Plural) Table name 'cart' is stripped from the beginning of
                                                                relation name 'cart_cart_line_items'
    cart.belongsToMany      as:'relatedCartLineItemProducts'    (Plural) No _id suffix. 'related' and relation name (table name striiped)
                                                                are added as prefix.
    cart.hasMany Through    as:'relatedcartLineItemProducts'    (Plural) No _id suffix. 'related' and relation name (table name striiped)
                                                                are added as prefix.
    lineItem.belongsTo      as:'relatedProduct'                 (Singular) No _id suffix. 'related' is added as prefix.
    lineItem.belongsTo      as:'cart'                           (Singular) _id suffix is stripped from foreign key name
                                                                'cart_id'.

Of course as all attributes, you can modify generated files in a non-destructive way as explained below.

### Very Easy to Override Auto Generated Files
By default auto generated files are located path/to/model/definition-files directory. Also there is 'definition-files-custom' directory. Users can create files with same names as auto generated files to override its attributes. There is also utils module generated to make modifications easier.

Those modifications are non destructive, because they override generated file in another file by inheriting it and default index.js file uses inherited files if it exists. Please bear in mind, those modifications occur before sequelize instances are generated.

For example for cart table 'definition-files/cart.js' is generated. User can create 'definition-files-custom/cart.js' and override necessary parts like example below. For all attributes you can look inside auto generated files.

    "use strict";
    var orm     = require('../index.js'),
        model   = require('../definition-files/public_cart.js'),
        util    = require('../utils.js')(model),
        Seq     = orm.Sequelize();

    module.exports = model;

    util.getAttribute('id').validate = {... Some Sequelize Validations}; // Add Sequelize validation.
    util.getRelation('relatedProducts').details.as = 'soldItems';        // Don't like default relation name? Change it.
    util.renameAttribute('customerId', 'clientId');                      // Change name of the attribute.

### Exclude Tables

It is possible to exclude some table from auto generation. (Config generate.skipTable:[]) array is used to define excluded tables. sequelize-pg-generator skips those tables and relations from and to those tables.

### Debug

When required and executed first time from your app, default index.js file creates a file called debug.js in the model directory. This file can be examined what type of code is used by index.js. It is same code that would be used if there is no index.js file exists. However if this type of static file is used, it is harder to allow modifications in a non-destructive way.

### Validates and Prevents Naming Clash
sequelize-pg-generator prevents naming clas by validating all relation names if same name/alias exists on the same table.

### Table Specific Configuration

Sometimes for some tables it is needed to have different rules then other tables have. In such situations configuration file allows table level overrides. All 'generate' and 'tableOptions' config parameters can be overridden with 'generateOverride' and 'tableOptionsOverride'.

Below is an example for contact table have specific configuration overrides.

    "generate": {
        "columnDescription": true,
        "tableDescription": true,
        ...
    },
    "generateOverride": {
        "contact": {
            "tableDescription": false
        }
    },
    "tableOptions": {
        "timestamps": false,
        "camelCase": true,
        "paranoid": false,
        ...
    },
    "tableOptionsOverride": {
        "contact": {
            "paranoid": true
        }
    }
    ...

Configuration
=============
Configuration parameters and default values are described below. Configuration is enclosed in "sequelize-pg-generator" key, because you may want to combine sequelize-pg-generator configuration with your main application configuration. This way generator's configuration does not clash with yours. [node-config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-config) allows this.

CAVEAT: Singleton Nature of Configuration
-----------------------------------------
This module uses config module via require('config') for configuration. Config module is a singleton as of this writing, which returns same config object for each request. As a result subsequent calls in the same process return same configuration even configuration file changed and/or sequelize-pg-generator constructor called with different config file.

This is usually no problem since generator supposed to be called once in the same process. However this behaviour prevents testing. Additionally you may want to avoid this behavior whatever reason. To side step this, it is added "resetConfig" option to constructor. If it is set to true it resets and rereads configuration. To do this we clear config module from node cache. It is sub-optimal solution suggested by lorenwest in github issues section.

To activate this behavior just set resetConfig to true or from cli add --resetConfig:

    var generator = require('sequelize-pg-generator');
    generator(function (err) {
        if (err) { callback(err); }
    }, {
        database: 'my_database',
        resetConfig: true
    );

sequelize-pg-creator uses the code below:

    global.NODE_CONFIG = null;
    delete require.cache[require.resolve('config')];
    config = require('config');

Template Variables (Customizing Templates)
==========================================
To create custom templates user can copy default templates or create from scratch then configure "template.folder" to use newly created templates. 3 files are required: index.ext (.ext is whatever your template engine's extension is), index.js, utils.js.

index.js and utils.js files will be copied directly to target model directory. index.ext template is executed for each table to create model files.

Variables available to use in templates are listed below. Please note if a value is undefined, it's key is also is deleted to make it easy to iterate only defined values in templates.

Examples
========

Eager Loading
-------------
sequelize-pg-generator sets up relations with an "as". Otherwise multiple relations between same two tables collides. For example:

account has many contacts as primaryContacts (account -----< contact)

account has many contacts as secondaryContacts (account ----< contact)

In this case sequelize.js requires you to specify "as" alias in the "as" attribute during eager loading.

    account = orm.model('public.account'); // Can be configured without schema.
    contact = orm.model('public.contact'); // Can be configured without schema.
    account.findAll({ include: [ { model: contact, as: "primaryContacts" } ] }).then(function(data) {
        console.log(data[0].primaryContacts[0].name);
    });
